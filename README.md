# IT_Salary

Hi, I'm Thanh Le. This is my first published project on GitHub.

This project is about using R to identify potential factors impacting the salary of IT employees in Australia. The project includes two main parts:

1. **Data Cleaning** to ensure consistency in data inputs and remove any missing values and outliers.
2. **Data Visualizations** to investigate the impact of each independent variable on the target variable "Salary".

To run the project, please follow the below steps:
1. Clone the repository by running the following command in the terminal: git clone https://github.com/your-username/IT_Salary.git
2. Download the RMarkdown file "21966155 - A3.Rmd", as well as data files "survey_employee_demographics.csv" and "survey_employee_employment_details.xlsx" to local computer and ensure they are in the same directory for proper data loading during analysis.
3. Open the project in RStudio
4. Install the required packages if they are not already installed. This can be done by running this command in RStudio: install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))
5. Download "survey_employee_demographics.csv" and "survey_employee_employment_details.xlsx" to local computer and ensure they are in the same directory as the RMarkdown file for proper data loading during analysis.
6. Run the RMarkdown file "21966155 - A3.Rmd" attached in RStudio
7. Finally, click the "Knit" button in RStudio to execute the entire analysis. This will run the data cleaning and generate visualizations, with the results outputted as an HTML report.
