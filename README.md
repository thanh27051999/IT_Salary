# IT_Salary

Hi, I'm Thanh Le. This is my first published project on GitHub.

This project is about using R to identify potential factors impacting the salary of IT employees in Australia. The project includes two main parts:

1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Data Visualizations** to investigate the impact of each independent variable on the target variable "Salary".
